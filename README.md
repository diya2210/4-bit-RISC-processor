# 4-bit-RISC-processor
In this project,I have designed a simple 4-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor in Verilog. The processor will execute basic instructions such as load, store, arithmetic, logical, and branch operations. The design will incorporate components like an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), a register file, a control unit, and memory modules.
